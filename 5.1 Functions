A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity 
for your application and a high degree of code reusing. As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. 
but you can also create your own functions.

def average(a,b):
    print("average of 2 nos is:",(a+b)/2)
average(10, 20)
        ####or
def average(a,b):
    return (a+b)/2
print(average(10, 20))

def calc(a,b):
    x=a+b
    y=a-b
    z=a*b
    u=a/b
    v=a%b
    return x,y,z,u,v
result=calc(10, 20)
#print(result)
for i in result:
    print(i)
