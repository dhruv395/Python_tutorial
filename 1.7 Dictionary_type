Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types
that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. A Dictionary in Python works similar to the Dictionary in a 
real world.

dict1={1:"john",2:"bob",3:"bill"}
print(dict1)

print(dict1.items())

k=dict1.keys()
for i in k:
    print(i)
    
v=dict1.values()
for i in v:
    print(i)
    
print(dict1[3])

del dict1[2]
print(dict1)
