The elements in the set cannot be duplicates.
The elements in the set are immutable(cannot be modified) but the set as a whole is mutable.
There is no index attached to any element in a python set. So they do not support any indexing or slicing operation

s={10,20,30,"xyz",10,20,30}
print(s)
print(type(s))

s.update([88,99])
print(s)
print(type(s))

#not supported function
#repetition 
#print(s*3)
#indexing 
#print(s[0])
#slicing
#print(s[0:5])

s.remove(30)
print(s)
