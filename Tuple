A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, 
the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets. Creating a tuple is as simple 
as putting different comma-separated values.

tpl=(40,50,40,"xyz")
print(tpl)

#indexing
print(tpl[3])

#repeatation
print(tpl*3)

#count the number
print(tpl.count(40))

#get the index number
print(tpl.index("xyz"))

#convert list to tuple
lst=[67,34,"xyz"]
print(type(lst))
tpl1=tuple(lst)
print(type(tpl1))
print(tpl1)
