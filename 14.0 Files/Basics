files: where we store data

f=open("filename","mode","buffer")      ->default buffer size is 4096 or 8092 and is optional
f.close()         ->mode: w-write, r-read, a-append, w+: write and read, r+:read, write and append, a+: appending & reading, x:exclusive 
                  -> above are for text files and for binary files we need to append "b" with above each mode.
